Hi, I am Arpit Sharma currently working as a Software Engineer in a Multinational Bank. My work is related to creating internal tools to aid users in making crucial decisions related to Corporate loans. It spans from the development of a web application for users to interact with the customer data and make adjustments to generating daily risk reports through Python scripting. I have mostly worked in the backend of the services while being the main point of contact for users.
